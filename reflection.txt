I think having the pseudocode of the dfs and bfs helped a lot when programming them.
Since I had no prior experience with programming in any language, I did struggle a lot 
and it took me a lot of time to figure out how to program the actual code of the dfs and bfs. 
I still am not sure if my program fully works, since I don't know how to run it.
